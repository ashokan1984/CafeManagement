Step 1: Please download the application and build, it will help to create the database in your local database and it will insert the necessary master data for initial CRUD operations.
Step 2: If in case DB is not created then go tools --> Nucket Package Manager Console --> Package Manager Console --> Update-Database. Mostly you no need to do this step because while building the application everything will be created by deafult.
step 3: I will attach sample sample Json data for your easy testing purpose. 
Step 4: In case if you face any issues call me directly 94656931. I am available any time for further assistance.

All these Apis are 100% working condition wiht positive flow. I am working on validations using fluent validations. I will keep push my changes.
